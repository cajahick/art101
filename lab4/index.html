		<h1>Challenges/Problems</h1>
		<p>I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with a computer task to pseudocode, and thankfully I was able to get help from my partner. The coding stuff was pretty self explanatory, but the pseudocoding took me a bit to figure out.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<h2>Task 1: How to Make a Painting</h2>
		<p>1. Grab paintbrush
			2. Clean paintbrush
			3. Dispense desired paint onto palette
			4. Dip brush in paint
			5. Apply paint to canvas
			6. Create desired image
			7. Rinse off brush with water</p>
		<h2>Task 2: Creating a Math Calculation Program</h2>
		<p>1. Create area for user to input two numbers.
		2. Create options for whether the user wants to add, subtract, multiply, or divide their numbers.
		3. Make "if" statements based on which option user selects
		4. Code in calculate button
		5. Test to see if program works properly</p>
		<h2>Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments</h2>
		<p>
		<pre><code>
	//Creating a math calculation program:
	//Create area for user to input two numbers
	  //Code in places where the user will input
	  //Link them created GUIs
	//Create options for whether the user wants to add, subtract, multiply, or divide their numbers
	  //Put each of the options under a list with selectable inputs
	//Make if statements based on which option user selects
	//Code in a Calculate button
	  //Create a GUI for it
	//Test to see if program works properly
	  //Try it using all four different variations
	  //If something is off, go back and fix it and then test it again.
